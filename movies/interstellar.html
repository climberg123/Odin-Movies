            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan. Interstellar follows a group of 
                astronauts who embark on a daring mission through a wormhole near Saturn to find a new habitable planet for humanity. 
                Led by Cooper, they navigate through cosmic anomalies and time dilation while grappling with the emotional toll of 
                leaving their loved ones behind. The film explores themes of love, sacrifice, and the resilience of the human spirit 
                in the face of existential challenges.</p>
